# Applying Regression and Classification Methods to Predict Income Using the Census Data
### Group116, Project 2 for DTU's Autumnn 2023 Course: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining (02450)
This repository contains the code we used to create project 2 in DTU's Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining course (02450, Autumn semester 2023).

The project focuses on applying supervised learning methods to Census data to solve classification and regression problems. It involves statistically evaluating models like linear regression and artificial neural networks using two-level cross-validation, while also comparing them against baseline models to assess their performance.
